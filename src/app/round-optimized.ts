 * Ultra-optimized number rounding function that preserves a given precision non-integer values (2 by default)

 *
 * @param {number} num - The number to round
 * @returns {number} The rounded result
 *
 * roundOptimized(23.456)      -> 23.46
 * roundOptimized(23.99999)    -> 24
 * roundOptimized(-23.456)     -> -23.46
 * roundOptimized(-23.99999)   -> -24
 * roundOptimized(23.004)      -> 23
 * roundOptimized(23.006)      -> 23.01
 *
 * Performance: MUCH faster than using toFixed() or similar string-based methods
 * Range: Safe for larger numbers, does not use bitwise operations
